This project implements a data table that fetches and displays financial data from an API. Users can filter the data by Date Range, Revenue, and Net Income within specified ranges. Additionally, the table allows sorting by Date (ascending/descending), Revenue (ascending/descending), and Net Income (ascending/descending).
